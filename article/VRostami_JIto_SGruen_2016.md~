# Introduction

The introduction should introduce the original paper and put it in context
(e.g. is it an important paper in the domain ?). You must also specify if there
was an implementation available somewhere and provide a link to it if relevant
(and in such a case, you have to specify if the proposed replication is based
on this original implementation). You should also introduce your implementation
by listing language, tools, libraries, etc. and motivate choices if relevant.

# Methods

The methods section should explain how you replicated the original results:

* did you use paper description
* did you contact authors ?
* did you use original sources ?
* did you modify some parts ?
* etc.

If relevevant in your domain, you should also provide a new standardized
description of the work.

>> **input: ** data, bin size, window size, window step, spike patterns, method

>> **output: ** time series of: suprise, nr of empirical coincidences, nr of expected
>> coincidences, average firing rate of each neuron

> Load data

> Descretize the data and represent as a binary sequences (`BinnedSpikeTrain()`
from _coversion_ module in Elephant)

> Represent spike patterns as hash values (`hash_from_pattern()`)


> **FOR** _each hash value_ **do**

>> Define the window positions (`_winpos()` and `_bintime()`)

>> **FOR** _each window_ **do**

>>> Generate the probability distribution of n_exp and calculate the p-value (`gen_pval_anal()`)

>>> Calculate n_emp (`n_emp_mat()` and `n_emp_mat_sum_trial()`)

>>> **If** method is _analytic_TrialAverage_ or _analytic_TrialByTrial_ **then**

>>>> **If** _method is TrialAverage_ **then**

>>>>> calculate n_exp based on analytic_TrialAverage (`_n_exp_mat_analytic()` and `n_exp_mat_sum_trial()`)

>>>> **Else if** _method is TrialByTrial_ **then**

>>>>> Calculate n exp based on analytic_TrialByTrial (`_n_exp_mat_analytic()` and `n_exp_mat_sum_trial()`)

>>>> Generate Poisson distribution with the mean n_exp

>>> **Else if** _method is surrogate_TrialByTrial_ **then**

>>>> Generate n exp distribution based on surrogates (`_n_exp_mat_surrogate()` and `n_exp_mat_sum_trial()`)

>>> Calculate p-value of n_emp given the distribution of n_exp

>> Calculate surprises from the p-values in different window positions (`jointJ()`)

# Results

Results should be compared with original results and you have to explain why
you think they are the same or why they may differ (qualitative result vs
quantitative result). Note that it is not necessary to redo all the original
analysis of the results.


# Conclusion

Conclusion, at the very minimum, should indicate very clearly if you were able
to replicate original results. If it was not possible but you found the reason
why (error in the original results), you should exlain it.
